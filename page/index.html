		<h1>BORDER BOTTOM LINE</h1>
		<h3>Awful immigration laws from around the world.</h3>
		<section><strong> Italy </strong> penalizes illegal immigrants with a fine of &#8364 5,000-10,000 and allows immigration officials to detain them for up to 6 months. <strong> &#8226 Switzerland </strong> immediately deports all convicted criminals from other countries andpotentially even their family members. <strong> &#8226 Australia</strong> detains all non-citizens without a valid visa. <strong>&#8226 Japan</strong> is allowed to pay $,3000 to each unemployed Latin American immigrant of Japanese descent and $2,000 to each of that unemployed worker's family members to return to their country of origin. &#8226 The <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> prohibits foreigners form engaging in any sort of labor union--like activy, resulting in harsh living conditions, 80-hour work weeks, back-breaking manual labor, and below-minimum-wage pay.</section>

		<p class="overflow-one">On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province's <strong>Banqiao Dam</strong> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
		<p class="overflow-two">Just after the 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, "The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!"</p>
		<p class="overflow-three">There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it "sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking." The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</p>
